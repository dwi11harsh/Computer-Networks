We are focusing on packet-switched networks and not bitstreams which are exchanged between nodes.

- It is the network adaptor that allows to nodes to exchange frames.
- When node A wishes to transmit a frame to node B, it tells its adaptor to transmit a frame from the node’s memory.
- This results in a sequence of bits being sent over the link.
- The adaptor on node B then collects together the sequence of bits arriving on the link and deposits the corresponding frame in B’s memory.
- Recognising exactly what set of bits constitute a frame—that is, determining where the frame begins and ends—is the central challenge faced by the adaptor.

# Byte-Oriented Protocols (PPP)
- These protocols follow _byte-oriented_ approach for framing problem.
**Byte-Oriented Approach**: One of the oldest approaches to framing is to view each frame as a collection of bytes (characters) rather than a collection of bits.

## Sentinel-based Approaches
- Binary Synchronous Communication (BISYNC) uses special character known as `sentinel character` to indicate where frame starts and where it ends.
- The beginning of a frame is denoted by sending a special SYN (synchronisation) character.
- The data portion of the frame is then contained between two more special characters: STX (start of text) and ETX (end of text).
- The SOH (start of header) field serves much the same purpose as the STX field.
- The problem with the sentinel approach, of course, is that the ETX character might appear in the data portion of the frame.

- BISYNC overcomes this problem by “escaping” the ETX character by preceding it with a data-link-escape (DLE) character whenever it appears in the body of a frame; the DLE character is also escaped (by preceding it with an extra DLE) in the frame body. This approach is often called ==character stuffing== because extra characters are inserted in the data portion of the frame.
- The frame format also includes a field labeled cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that is used to detect transmission error

_The more recent PPP, which is commonly used to carry Internet Protocol packets over various sorts of point-to-point links, is similar to BISYNC in that it also uses sentinels and character stuffing._

The special start-of-text character, denoted as the ***Flag*** field in Figure 13, is 01111110.

***Address field**:* Contains the value 11111111, which is the broadcast address. This field is one byte long.

***Control field***: Contains the value 00000011, which indicates that user data is to be transmitted in an `unsequenced` frame. This field is also one byte long.

The ***Protocol*** field is used for demultiplexing: it identifies the high-level protocol such as IP or IPX (an IP-like protocol developed by Novell).

The ***frame payload*** size can be negotiated, but it is 1,500 bytes by default.

The ***Checksum*** field is either 2 (by default) or 4 bytes long.

- The PPP frame format is unusual in that several of the field sizes are negotiated rather than fixed.
- This negotiation is conducted by a protocol called Link Control Protocol (LCP).
