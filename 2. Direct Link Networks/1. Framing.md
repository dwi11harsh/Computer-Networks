We are focusing on packet-switched networks and not bitstreams which are exchanged between nodes.

- It is the network adaptor that allows to nodes to exchange frames.
- When node A wishes to transmit a frame to node B, it tells its adaptor to transmit a frame from the node’s memory.
- This results in a sequence of bits being sent over the link.
- The adaptor on node B then collects together the sequence of bits arriving on the link and deposits the corresponding frame in B’s memory.
- Recognising exactly what set of bits constitute a frame—that is, determining where the frame begins and ends—is the central challenge faced by the adaptor.

# Byte-Oriented Protocols (PPP)
- These protocols follow _byte-oriented_ approach for framing problem.
**Byte-Oriented Approach**: One of the oldest approaches to framing is to view each frame as a collection of bytes (characters) rather than a collection of bits.

## Sentinel-based Approaches
- Binary Synchronous Communication (BISYNC) uses special character known as `sentinel character` to indicate where frame starts and where it ends.
- The beginning of a frame is denoted by sending a special SYN (synchronisation) character.
- The data portion of the frame is then contained between two more special characters: STX (start of text) and ETX (end of text).
- The SOH (start of header) field serves much the same purpose as the STX field.
- The problem with the sentinel approach, of course, is that the ETX character might appear in the data portion of the frame.

- BISYNC overcomes this problem by “escaping” the ETX character by preceding it with a data-link-escape (DLE) character whenever it appears in the body of a frame; the DLE character is also escaped (by preceding it with an extra DLE) in the frame body. This approach is often called ==character stuffing== because extra characters are inserted in the data portion of the frame.
- The frame format also includes a field labeled cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that is used to detect transmission error

_The more recent PPP, which is commonly used to carry Internet Protocol packets over various sorts of point-to-point links, is similar to BISYNC in that it also uses sentinels and character stuffing._

The special start-of-text character, denoted as the ***Flag*** field in Figure 13, is 01111110.

***Address field**:* Contains the value 11111111, which is the broadcast address. This field is one byte long.

***Control field***: Contains the value 00000011, which indicates that user data is to be transmitted in an `unsequenced` frame. This field is also one byte long.

The ***Protocol*** field is used for demultiplexing: it identifies the high-level protocol such as IP or IPX (an IP-like protocol developed by Novell).

The ***frame payload*** size can be negotiated, but it is 1,500 bytes by default.

The ***Checksum*** field is either 2 (by default) or 4 bytes long.

- The PPP frame format is unusual in that several of the field sizes are negotiated rather than fixed.
- This negotiation is conducted by a protocol called Link Control Protocol (LCP).

**NOTE**: Link-layer protocols can be identified by the fact that they run over single links. Network layer protocols, by contrast, run over switched networks that contain lots of links interconnected by switches or routers.
Layering makes a good slave, but a poor master.
## Byte-Counting Approach
- The number of bytes contained in a frame can be included as a field in the frame header.
- The DECNET’s DDCMP protocol uses this approach

- the `COUNT` field specifies how many bytes are contained in the frame's body.
- In case where this `COUNT` field gets corrupted, the end of the frame would not be detected correctly.
- Should this happen, the receiver will accumulate as many bytes as the bad `COUNT` field indicates and then use the error detection field to determine that the frame is bad. This is known as ***framing-error***.

# Bit-Oriented Protocols(HDLC)
Unlike byte-oriented protocols, a bit-oriented protocol is not concerned with byte boundaries—it simply views the frame as a collection of bits.

The Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) protocol developed by IBM is an example of a bit-oriented protocol
SDLC was later standardised by the ISO as the High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)

- HDLC denotes both the beginning and the end of a frame with the distinguished bit sequence `01111110`.
- This sequence is also transmitted during any times that the link is idle so that the sender and receiver can keep their clocks synchronised.
- the bits `01111110` might cross byte boundaries—bit-oriented protocols use the analog of the DLE character, a technique known as bit stuffing.

# Clock-Based Framing (SONET)
Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) standard
- It is the dominant standard for long-distance transmission of data over optical networks.
- SONET addresses both the framing problem and the encoding problem.
- It also addresses a problem that is very important for phone companies—the multiplexing of several low-speed links onto one high-speed link.

_Lowest-speed SONET link, which is known as STS-1 and runs at 51.84 Mbps._
- The first 2 bytes of the frame contain a special bit pattern, and it is these bytes that enable the receiver to determine where the frame starts.
- since bit stuffing is not used, there is no reason why this pattern will not occasionally turn up in the payload portion of the frame.
- To guard against this, the receiver looks for the special bit pattern consistently, hoping to see it appearing once every 810 bytes, since each frame is 9 × 90 = 810 bytes long. When the special pattern turns up in the right place enough times, the receiver concludes that it is in sync and can then interpret the frame correctly.

- Additional complexity comes from the fact that SONET provides a considerably richer set of services than just data transfer. For example, 64 Kbps of a SONET link’s capacity is set aside for a voice channel that is used for maintenance.
- A given SONET link runs at one of a finite set of possible rates, ranging from 51.84 Mbps (STS-1) to 2,488.32 Mbps (STS-48), and beyond.
- all of these rates are integer multiples of STS-1.
- The significance for framing is that a single SONET frame can contain subframes for multiple lower-rate channels.
- three STS-1 frames fit exactly in a single STS-3 frame.
- Intuitively, the STS-N frame can be thought of as consisting of N STS-1 frames,
- the payload from these STS-1 frames can be linked together to form a larger STS-N payload; such a link is denoted STS-Nc (for *concatenated*).
