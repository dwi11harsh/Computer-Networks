*Success of the internet*: As a result, new applications and services—electronic commerce, videoconferencing, and packet telephony, to name a few—have been showing up at a phenomenal pace.
New functionality can be added readily with “just a small matter of programming.”

# Application Programming Interface (Sockets)
- The place to start when implementing a network application is the interface exported by the network.
- Since most network protocols are implemented in software and nearly all computer systems implement their network protocols as part of the operating system, when we refer to the interface “exported by the network,” we are generally referring to the interface that the OS provides to its networking subsystem. This interface is often called the network ==application programming interface (API)==.

### Unix domain socket
A ***Unix domain socket***, also known as an IPC socket, is a way for processes on the same Unix or Unix-like operating system to communicate with each other by exchanging data. Unix sockets are a type of inter-process communication (IPC) that use a local file system socket instead of network sockets.

##### Socket
think of a socket as the point where a local application process attaches to the network. The interface defines operations for creating a socket, attaching the socket to the network, sending/receiving messages through the socket, and closing the socket.

#### On Server Side
The first step is to create a socket, which is done with the following operation:

```c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)
```

##### `domain` argument
specifies the protocol *family* that is going to be used

| Argument    | Family Name                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PF_INET`   | Internet Family                                                                  |
| `PF_UNIX`   | Unix pipe facility                                                               |
| `PF_PACKET` | direct access to network interface (i.e., it bypasses the TCP/IP protocol stack) |
##### `type` argument
indicates semantics of communication.

| Argument      | Semantic Name                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SOCK_STREAM` | used to denote a byte stream                                      |
| `SOCK_DGRAM`  | denotes a message-oriented service, such as that provided by UDP. |
##### `protocol` argument
identifies the specific protocol that is going to be used.
In this case, this argument is `UNSPEC` because the combination of `PF_NET` and `SOCK_STREAM` implies TCP.

##### Return Value 
the return value from **socket** is a *handle* for the newly created socket, that is, an identifier by which we can refer to the socket in the future. It is given as an argument to subsequent operations on this socket.

The next step depends on weather you are a client or a server.
On server machine, the application performs a ==passive== open-the server says that it is prepared to accept connections, but it does not actually establish a connection. The server does this by invoking following three ops:

```c
int bind(int socket, struct sockaddr* address, int addr_len)
int listen(int socket, int backlog)
int accept(int socket, struct sockaddr* address, int* address_len)
```

##### `bind` operation
- binds newly created socket to specified `address`. 
- This is the network address for the local participant - the server.
- when used with the Internet protocols, address is a data structure that includes both the IP address of the server and a TCP port number.
The port number is usually some well-known number specific to the service being offered; for example, web servers commonly accept connections on port 80.

##### `listen` operation
- defines how many connections can be pending on the specified **socket**.

##### `accept` operation
- carries out passive open.
- It is a blocking operation that does not return until a remote participant has established a connection, and when it does complete, it returns a new socket that corresponds to this just-established connection.
- The `address` argument contains the _remote_ participant's address.
When accept returns, the original socket that was given as an argument still exists and still corresponds to the passive open; it is used in future invocations of accept.

#### On Client Side
On the client machine, the application process performs an active open; that is, it says who it wants to communicate with by invoking the following single operation:

```c
int connect(int socket, struct sockaddr* address, int address_len)
```

This operation does not return until TCP has successfully established a connection, at which time the application is free to begin sending data.

##### `address`
- contains the remote participant's address
- In practice, the client usually specifies only the remote participant’s address and lets the system fill in the local information.

Once a connection is established, the application processes invoke the following two operations to send and receive data:

```c
int send(int socket, char* message, int msg_len, int flags)
int recv(int socket, char* buffer, int buf_len, int flags)
```

The first operation sends the given ***message*** over the specified ***socket***, while the second operation receives a message from the specified ***socket*** into the given ***buffer***. Both operations take a set of ***flags*** that control certain details of the operation.

# Example Application
Implementation of a simple client/server program that uses the socket interface to send messages over a TCP connection. A simplified version of Unix **talk** program

## Client
- takes the name of the remote machine as an argument
- calls Unix utility `gethostbyname` to translate this name into the remote address.
- now construct address data structure (`sin`) expected by the socket interface
- now setup a call `socket` and connect
- Once the `connect` operation returns, the connection is established and the client program enters its main loop, which reads text from standard input and sends it over the socket
