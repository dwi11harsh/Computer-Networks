# Requirements to Build a Computer Network
Expectation of different individuals from such a network:
1. **Application Programmer**: would list services that his application needs.
2. **Network Designer**: would list the properties of a cost-effective design (efficiently utilise network resources)
3. **Network Provider**: would list characteristics of a system that is easy to administer.
### Connectivity
A system that is designed to support growth to an arbitrarily large size is said to ==scale==.
#### Links, Nodes and Clouds
- **Link**: physical medium, such as a coaxial cable or an optical fibre. 
- **Nodes**: computers or others devices connected by such _links_.
- **Point-to-point Link**: physical links limited to a pair of nodes.
- **Multiple-access Link**: links with more than two nodes

- multiple-access links are often limited in size, in terms of both the geographical distance they can cover and the number of nodes they can connect.
- if computers networks were limited to physical connections only, such connections would come out to be expensive and unmanageable.
- Fortunately, connectivity between two nodes can also be indirect in case of cooperating nodes.
- **Switched Network**: nodes that are attached to at least two links, running a software that forwards data received on one link out to another and organised in a systemic way
- Most common switched networks:
	- *Circuit-switched*: employed by the telephone system
	- *Packet-switched*: used by majority of computer networks

##### Packet-switched Networks
- nodes in such a network send discrete blocks of data to each other
- we call each block a ==packet== or ==message==.
- these networks use ==store-and-forward== strategy.
###### Store-and-forward
- each node first receives a complete packet over some link
- stores the packet in its internal memory
- then forwards the complete packet to the next node
In the above diagram devices inside the clout are called ==switches== and the nodes connected to the cloud are called ==hosts==.

Across this study, whenever a cloud is seen in any diagram, it can be thought of as a placeholder for any of the networking technology.

- **Router | Gateway**: a node connected to two or more networks. It is similar to a switch, it forwards messages form one network to another.

- In order to successfully establish a network, we also need to be able to establish host-to-host connectivity.
- **Address**: is a byte string that identifies a node.
- **Routing**: The process of determining systematically how to forward messages toward the destination node based on its address is called routing.
- It is also possible that the source node might want to ==broadcast== a message to all the nodes on the network.
- Or a source node might want to send a message to some subset of the other nodes, but not all of them, a situation called ==multicast==.

<font style="color:B1D690">The main idea to take away from this discussion is that we can define a _network_ recursively as consisting of two or more nodes connected by a physical link, or as two or more networks connected by a node. In other words, a network can be constructed from a nesting of networks, where at the bottom level, the network is implemented by some physical medium. One of the key challenges in providing network connectivity is to define an address for each node that is reachable on the network (including support for broadcast and multicast connectivity), and to be able to use this address to route messages toward the appropriate destination node(s).</font>

### Cost-Effective Resource Sharing
- **Efficiency**: key requirement of CN that leads to ==packet switching== as the strategy of choice.
`Question` How do several hosts share the same _link_ when they all want to use at the same time?
`Multiplexing`: data being sent by multiple users can be multiplexed (shared) over the physical links that make up a network
![[Screenshot 2024-10-28 at 1.13.07 PM.png]]
_signal from S1, S2 and S3 is first multiplexed at Switch 1 and then demultiplexed at Switch 2 and sent to R1, R2 and R3 respectively._
`Synchronous Time-Division Multiplexing (STDM)`: The idea is to divide time into equal-sized quanta and, in a round-robin fashion, give each flow a chance to send its data over the physical link.

`Frequency Division Method (FDM)`: The idea is to transmit each flow over the physical link at a different frequency.

`Limitation of STDM & FDM`
1. if one of the flows (host pairs) does not have any data to send, its share of the physical link—that is, its time quantum or its frequency—remains idle, even if one of the other flows has data to transmit
2. Both STDM and FDM are limited to situations in which the maximum number of flows is fixed and known ahead of time. It is not practical to resize the quantum or to add additional quanta in the case of STDM or to add new frequencies in the case of FDM.

`Statistical Multiplexing`: dynamically allocates time slots to equipment that needs to transmit data. It also merges data packets from multiple input lines and forwards them to multiple outputs.

`packet`: Upper bound for the size of data that a program can transmit at a time.
- The source may need to fragment the message into several packets, with the receiver reassembling the packets back into the original message.
![[Screenshot 2024-10-28 at 2.01.43 PM.png]]
_in case more than one source needs to send packets_
- Its upto switch that decides which packets to send next in a packet-switch network.
- Each switch in a packet-switched network makes this decision independently, on a packet-by-packet basis.
- A network that attempts to allocate bandwidth to particular flows is sometimes said to support _quality of service (QoS)_

- A switch has a buffer in which it stores the data received in case it is not able to send with the same speed with which it receives the data. In case the buffer is filled then some of the packets will have to be dropped. When a switch is operating in this state, it is said to be ==congested==.

<font style="color:B1D690">The bottom line is that statistical multiplexing defines a cost-effective way for multiple users (e.g., host-to-host flows of data) to share network resources (links and nodes) in a fine-grained manner. It defines the packet as the granularity with which the links of the network are allocated to different flows, with each switch able to schedule the use of the physical links it is connected to on a per-packet basis. Fairly allocating link capacity to different flows and dealing with congestion when it occurs are the key challenges of statistical multiplexing.</font>

### Support for Common Service
It is more accurate to think of a network as providing the means for a set of application processes that are distributed over those computers to communicate rather than thinking of it as simply delivering packets among a collection of computers.

Intuitively, we can see network as providing ==channels== over which application level processes can communicate with each other; each channel provides the set of services required by application.
In other words we now think of _channel as connecting one process to another_.

In general, a network provides a variety of different types of _channels_, with each application selecting the type that best meets its needs.

#### Identifying Common Communication Process
- `File Access Program`: one of the earliest application supported on any network. Examples: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or NFS (Network File System).
- The process that requests access to the file is called the _client_, and the process that supports access to the file is called the _server_.

- ==request/reply channel==:a messaging pattern that allows two applications to communicate with each other by simulating separate channels for requests and replies. eg-web
	- used by the file transfer and digital library applications
	- guarantees that every message sent by one side is received by the other side and that only one copy of each message is delivered
	- protects the privacy and integrity of the data that flows over it

- ==message/stream channel==
	- could be used by both the video-on-demand and videoconferencing applications
	- might not need to guarantee that all messages are delivered
	- need to ensure that messages that are delivered arrive in the same order in which they were sent
	- ensure the privacy and integrity of the video data
	- might need to support multicast
#### Reliability
- To make a reliable system, it is first required to study the kinds of failures that we may encounter as networks do not exist in a perfect world.
- A major requirement of a network is to recover from certain kinds of failures.
There are three general classes of failures:
##### 1. bit error
- 1 is turned into a 0 or vice versa
- typically occur because outside forces, such as lightning strikes
- these are fairly rare, i.e., on average only one out of every 106 to 107 bits on a typical copper-based cable and one out of every 1012 to 1014 bits on a typical optical fibre.
- Once detected, it is sometimes possible to correct for such errors—if we know which bit or bits are corrupted, we can simply flip them
##### 2. burst error
- several consecutive bits are corrupted
##### 3. At Physical Level
- at the node and link level; that is, a physical link is cut, or the computer it is connected to crashes
- these are also common
- One of the difficulties in dealing with this class of failure is distinguishing between a failed computer and one that is merely slow
- or in the case of a link, between one that has been cut and one that is very flaky and therefore introducing a high number of bit errors.

<font style="color:B1D690">The key idea to take away from this discussion is that defining useful channels involves both understanding the applications’ requirements and recognizing the limita- tions of the underlying technology. The challenge is to fill in the gap between what the application expects and what the underlying technology can provide. This is sometimes called the semantic gap.</font>

**Semantic Gap**:the difference between two descriptions of an object by different linguistic representations
