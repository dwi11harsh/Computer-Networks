**Requirements discussed in previous section for network design**
- a computer network must provide general, cost- effective, fair, and robust connectivity among a large number of computers.
- networks must evolve to accommodate changes in both the underlying technologies upon which they are based as well as changes in the demands placed on them by application programs

==Network Architecture==: general blueprints that guide the design and implementation of networks.

# Layering and Protocols
- The general idea is that you start with the services offered by the underlying hardware, and then add a sequence of layers, each providing a higher (more abstract) level of service.
- The services provided at the high layers are implemented in terms of the services provided by the low layers.
==Protocol== provides a communication service that higher-level objects (such as application processes, or perhaps higher-level protocols) use to exchange messages.

Each protocol defines two interfaces
###### 1. Service Interface
- to the other objects on the same computer that want to use its communication services.
- defines the operations that local objects can perform on the protocol.
- For example, a request/reply protocol would support operations by which an application can send and receive messages
###### 2. Peer Interface
- defines the form and meaning of messages exchanged between protocol peers to implement the communication service.
- This would determine the way in which a request/reply protocol on one machine communicates with its peer on another machine.

<font style="color:B1D690">To summarize, a protocol defines a communication service that it exports locally (the service interface), along with a set of rules governing the messages that the protocol exchanges with its peer(s) to implement this service (the peer interface).</font>

###### Protocol Graph
- There are potentially multiple protocols at any given level, each providing a different communication service.
- We therefore represent the suite of protocols that make up a network system with a protocol graph.
- The _nodes_ of the graph correspond to protocols
- the _edges_ represent a ==depends on== relation.

Two or more protocol modules that do accurately implement a protocol specification are said to ==interoperate== with each other.

<u>there exist standardisation bodies, such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), that establish policies for a particular protocol graph.</u>

**Network Architecture**: <u>the set of rules governing the form and content of a protocol graph</u>

## Encapsulation
**Header**: is a small data structure—from a few bytes to a few dozen bytes—that is used among peers to communicate with each other, usually attached to the front of a message or else it is called **trailer**.

The rest of the message—that is, the data being transmitted on behalf of the application—is called the _message’s body_ or _payload_.

We say that the application’s data is ==encapsulated== in the new message created by protocol.
This process of encapsulation is then repeated at each level of the protocol graph.

<font style="color:B1D690">      When we say a low-level protocol does not interpret the message it is given by some high-level protocol, we mean that it does not know how to extract any meaning from the data contained in the message. It is sometimes the case, however, that the low-level protocol applies some simple transformation to the data it is given, such as to compress or encrypt it. In this case, the protocol is transforming the entire body of the message, including both the original application’s data and all the headers attached to that data by higher-level protocols.</font>

## Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
Recall that the fundamental idea of packet switching is to multiplex multiple flows of data over a single physical link.

The header that RRP (request/reply protocol) attaches to its messages contains an identifier that records the application to which the message belongs. We call this identifier RRP’s ==demultiplexing key==, or ==demux key== for short.

When the message is delivered to RRP on the destination host, it strips its header, examines the demux key, and demultiplexes the message to the correct application.

Nearly every protocol implements this mechanism of multiplexing.

# OSI Architecture
The ISO formally defined a common way  to connect computers and their architecture was called *Open Systems Architecture (OSI)*.

Here, one or more protocols implement the functionality assigned to a given layer.

##### Physical Layer
handles the transmission of raw bits over a communications link

##### Data Link Layer
then collects a stream of bits into a larger aggregate called a ***frame***.
- Network adaptors, along with device drivers running in the node’s OS, typically implement the data link level
- This means that frames, not raw bits, are actually delivered to hosts.

##### Network Layer
handles routing among nodes within a packet-switched network.
- At this layer, the unit of data exchanged among nodes is typically called a *packet* rather than a *frame* although they are fundamentally the same thing.

**NOTE**:<u>The lower three layers are implemented on all network nodes, including switches within the network and hosts connected along the exterior of the network</u>

##### Transport Layer
it implements process-to-process channel
- Here, the unit of data exchanged is commonly called a message rather than a packet or a frame.

**NOTE**:<u>The transport layer and higher layers typically run only on the end hosts and not on the intermediate switches or routers.</u>

##### Application Layer
Application layer protocols include things like the File Transfer Protocol

##### Presentation Layer
is concerned with the format of data exchanged between peers
- for example, whether an integer is 16, 32, or 64 bits long and whether the most significant byte is transmitted first or last, or how a video stream is formatted.

##### Session Layer
provides a name space that is used to tie together the potentially different transport streams that are part of a single application.
- For example, it might manage an audio stream and a video stream that are being combined in a teleconferencing application.

# Internet Architecture
sometimes also called TCP/IP architecture

##### Lowest Layer
- a wide variety of network protocols, denoted NET1, NET2 and so on
- In practice, these protocols are implemented by a combination of hardware
##### Second Layer
- consists of a single protocol—the ***Internet Protocol (IP)***
- This is the protocol that supports the interconnection of multiple networking technologies into a single, logical internetwork.
##### Third Layer
- contains two main protocols—the ***Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)*** and the ***User Datagram Protocol (UDP)***.
- TCP and UDP provide alternative logical channels to application programs
- TCP provides a reliable byte-stream channel
- UDP provides an unreliable datagram delivery channel (datagram may be thought of as a synonym for message)
- In the language of the Internet, TCP and UDP are sometimes called end-to-end protocols, although it is equally correct to refer to them as transport protocols.
##### Fourth Layer
- Running above the transport layer are a range of application protocols, such as FTP, TFTP (Trivial File Transport Protocol),

## Features of  Internet Architecture
1. The Internet architecture does not imply strict layering. The application is free to bypass the defined transport layers and to directly use IP or one of the underlying networks. Programmers are free to define new channel abstractions or applications that run on top of any of the existing protocols.
2. The issue of delivering messages from host to host is completely separated from the issue of providing a useful process-to-process communication service. Below IP, the architecture allows for arbitrarily many different network technologies, ranging from Ethernet to wireless to single point-to-point links.

<font style="color:B1D690">Of these three attributes of the Internet architecture, the hourglass design philos- ophy is important enough to bear repeating. The hourglass’s narrow waist represents a minimal and carefully chosen set of global capabilities that allows both higher-level applications and lower-level communication technologies to coexist, share capabilities, and evolve rapidly. The narrow-waisted model is critical to the Internet’s ability to adapt rapidly to new user demands and changing technologies.</font>
